### Important
This project is currently not being maintained, but I plan on revamping it shortly. Probably sometime in 2017. The project itself should still be fully functional, but plugins can not be installed.

### What is Extension Framework
Extension Framework was designed for building Chrome, Safari, and Opera extensions in one, as well as providing a file structure with grunt setup and ready to go. When creating new projects, getting started was always an issue, with no defined file structure and different requirements for Chrome and Safari. After cloning the sample project, you can be up and run in seconds.
