### ExtJS Library
This is the core of [Extension-Framework](https://github.com/Christianjuth/Extension-Framework). Please reference [that repo's wiki](https://github.com/Christianjuth/Extension-Framework/wiki) for more info and a full list of functions.

###About this Project

Extension Framework was designed for building Chrome, Safari, and Opera extensions in one, as well as providing a file structure with grunt setup and ready to go. When creating new projects, getting started was always an issue, with no defined file structure and different requirements for Chrome and Safari. After cloning the sample project, you can be up and run in seconds.
