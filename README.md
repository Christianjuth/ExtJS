###About this Project

This project started as a way to save myself time. I have built a few browser extensions, but there have always been two problems I have run into. The first is the main focus of this framework. Safari is a pain. I started off with Chrome extensions which are so easy to write. Google has done a perfect job of providing the right APIs without overloading the developers with features. Safri is a diffrent story. While this framework might limit some of the functionality of Safari extensions, I beleive it will make them less overwelming for new developers. The second problem, I hope to solve, is the structure. When creating new projects I never know where to start. By providing a freamwork everything has a place. This framwork is what I consider the best development workflow. Clone a git project, change a few files, run the grunt command in the terminal, and you are done.
