#Welcome to ExtJS
This project allowed you to build extensions for Chrome, Safari, and Opera using the same code.

### About this Project
This project started as a way to save myself time.  I have built a few browser extensions, but there have always been two problems I have run into.  The first is the main focus of this framework.  Safari is a pain.  I started off with Chrome extensions which are so easy to write.  Google has done a perfect job of providing the right APIs without overloading the developers with features.  Safri is a diffrent story.  While this framework might limit some of the functionality of Safari extensions, I beleive it will make them less overwelming for new developers.  The second problem, I hope to solve, is the structure.  When creating new projects I never know where to start.  By providing a freamwork everything has a place.  This framwork is what I consider the best development workflow.  Clone a git project, change a few files, run the grunt command in the terminal, and you are done.
