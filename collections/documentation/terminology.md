#Terminology
Since Extension Framework is a framework for Chrome, Safari , and Opera the terminology is a mixture from all three browsers.

### Core Library
You are going to hear this a lot because it is a key part of Extension Framework. This is a javascript library contained in the Extension Framework Framework.

### Config or Configure
When we say config or configure file we are referring to the `app/configure.json` file found in our framework. Every-so-often we say Chrome, Safari, or Opera config in which case we am referring to the native configure files for each extension.

### Popup
Popup refers to the html file that is shown when you click on an extensions menu icon.

### Page
Page is just a word we use in the place of view or screen. We wanted to keep the language simple and straightforward so rather than saying view or screen we decided to just call it what it is.

### Plugins
This is a term you will hear thrown around a lot. It may be a little misleading at first but plugins refer to [core library](documentation/terminology#core-library) functions.
