#Understanding ExtJS
This project allowes you to build extensions for Chrome, Safari, and Opera using the same code.

###What is ExtJS?
Meet ExtJS. A simple framework for building one extension that runs on Chrome, Safari, and Opera. Unlike other tools that provide a similar service, the ExtJS framework will compile down to one extension that runs on three browsers. This is done using a core library that detects the browser and runs native code at runtime. Because of this, rather than creating messy marching generated code, your extension will be clean, have structure, and be %100 open source friendly.

###How does it work?
There are two main peices to ExtJS. The first is the framework which is resposible for getting your extension to load in Chrome, Safari, and Opera. The second is the core libary which is responsible for getting your extension to run on all these browsers.
