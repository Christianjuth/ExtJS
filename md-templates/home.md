#Welcome to ExtJS
This project allowes you to build extensions for Chrome, Safari, and Opera using the same code.

### What is ExtJS?
Meet ExtJS. A simple framework for building one extension that runs on Chrome, Safari, and Opera. Unlike other tools that provide a similar service, the ExtJS framework will compile down to one extension that runs on three browsers. This is done using a core library that detects the browser and runs native code at runtime. Because of this, rather than creating messy marching generated code, your extension will be clean, have structure, and be %100 open source friendly.
