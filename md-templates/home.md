#Welcome
ExtJS is a opensource project that allowes you to build extensions for Chrome, Safari, and Opera using the same code.

###No More Browser Compatibility Issues
Meet ExtJS. A simple framework for building one extension that runs on Chrome, Safari, and Opera. Unlike other tools that provide a similar service, the ExtJS framework will compile down to one extension that runs on three browsers. This is done using a core library that detects the browser and runs native code at runtime. Because of this, rather than creating messy machine generated code, your extension will be clean, have structure, and be 100% open source friendly. [Read more...](documentation/understanding-extjs)

###Try Our Example Extension
Meet TabSaver, a simple extension that closes old tabs as you open new ones. Ever have 20+ tabs open because you do not close them as you go? TabSaver will find the oldest tab and close it. You can set the max amount of tabs allowed in settings. [Download TabSaver](http://code.ext-js.org/example-extensions/tab-saver.safariextension.zip)
